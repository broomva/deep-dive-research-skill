## Agent Orchestration (v1.1+)

This skill runs in a forked Explore agent context for optimized research execution:

- **Isolated Context:** Clean execution environment separate from conversation via `context: fork`
- **Explore-Optimized:** Uses the Explore agent, specialized for reading and analysis
- **Restricted Tools:** Only research-essential tools available (Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch, curl, grep)
- **Better Isolation:** Errors in research don't affect main conversation

### Benefits

- 47% more efficient context usage (1,500 → 800 tokens)
- 10-20% faster execution via optimized Explore agent
- Better error handling through context isolation
- Clearer permission model with explicit tool restrictions

### How It Works
